SafePlan README Checklist
=========================

1. Project Title & Tagline
   - Name of the project + one-line description.

2. Overview
   - What SafePlan is.
   - Why it matters (safety + optimality gap in existing benchmarks).
   - Who it’s for (robotics researchers, path planning developers, safe RL folks).

3. Key Features
   - Planner-agnostic design.
   - Safety + smoothness + optimality metrics.
   - Batch evaluation.
   - Extensibility.
   - Visualization support (2D/3D).

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - List and briefly explain each metric.
   - Group into categories:
     - Efficiency & Success
     - Smoothness
     - Safety
     - Optimality

5. Supported Planners
   - List included planners (A*, Weighted A*, Voronoi, UPP, SDF-A*, Optimized A*, RRT variants, etc.).
   - Note: more can be added easily.

6. Installation
   - Dependencies (Python version, packages like NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, Plotly, NetworkX).
   - Setup instructions (e.g., `git clone` + `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - Optional: Docker instructions.

7. Usage
   - Running a single experiment.
   - Running batch experiments.
   - Visualizing results.
   - Example commands.

8. Results & Visualization
   - Example outputs (plots, tables, stats).
   - Screenshots or embedded images (2D grid + 3D maps).
   - Mention where results are saved (`outputs/`, `results/`).

9. Extending SafePlan
   - Adding a new planner (inherit BasePlanner).
   - Adding a new metric (update metrics/).
   - Modifying configs.

10. Project Structure
   - Tree view of repo folders (planners, metrics, utils, configs, outputs, results).

11. Roadmap / Future Work
   - Planned new planners (PRM, RRT*, kinodynamic, multi-robot).
   - Expanding safety metrics.
   - Benchmark dataset release.
   - Standardized evaluation maps.

12. Citation
   - BibTeX entry (for academic papers).
   - DOI if released on Zenodo.

13. License
   - Open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.).
