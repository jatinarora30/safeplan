Safe A*: This approach is conceptually inspired by the inflation layer in the ROS Navigation framework
     where traversal costs are increased in proportion to proximity to obstacles. Unlike Nav2, which uses an exponential decay function to inflate costs, 
    we adopt a simplified inverse-distance formulation to achieve a similar safety bias.
