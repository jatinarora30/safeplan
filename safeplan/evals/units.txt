SafePlan Benchmarking Metrics
===============================

1. Path Cost (m)
----------------
Definition:
    Total geometric length of the path from start to goal.
Computation:
    Sum of Euclidean distances between consecutive waypoints, multiplied by cell size.
Interpretation:
    Lower cost means a shorter, more efficient path.
Unit:
    Meters (m).

2. Planning Time (ms)
---------------------
Definition:
    CPU time taken by the planner to compute a path.
Computation:
    Wall-clock difference between start and end of plan() call.
Interpretation:
    Lower time = faster algorithm. Useful for benchmarking efficiency.
Unit:
    Milliseconds (ms).

3. Success Rate (%)
-------------------
Definition:
    Fraction of planning queries where a valid path to the goal is found.
Computation:
    (#successful plans / #total attempts) × 100
Interpretation:
    Higher success rate = more reliable planner.
Unit:
    Percentage (%).

4. Distance to Goal (m, in failures)
------------------------------------
Definition:
    Remaining Euclidean distance between the last reached node and the goal when planning fails.
Computation:
    Distance between last expanded/returned path node and goal.
Interpretation:
    Smaller values mean the planner got closer to the goal before failing.
Unit:
    Meters (m).

5. Number of Nodes in Path
---------------------------
Definition:
    Count of waypoints in the final planned path.
Interpretation:
    Reflects smoothness and simplicity; fewer nodes generally mean a straighter path.
Unit:
    Count (integer).

6. Peak Memory (KB)
-------------------
Definition:
    Maximum RAM used by the planner during execution.
Computation:
    Retrieved from OS metrics (RSS or working set peak).
Interpretation:
    Measures memory efficiency of the planner.
Unit:
    Kilobytes (KB).

7. Turning Angle (°)
--------------------
Definition:
    Sum of angular deviations between consecutive path segments.
Computation:
    Compute angle via dot product between vectors, sum all deviations.
Interpretation:
    High turning angles indicate a less smooth path with sharp turns.
Unit:
    Degrees (°).

8. Jerk per Meter
-----------------
Definition:
    Rate of change of acceleration along the path, normalized per unit distance.
Computation:
    Third derivative of position along the discretized path.
Interpretation:
    Captures dynamic smoothness. Lower jerk → smoother, more stable trajectories.
Unit:
    Dimensionless (jerk per meter).

9. Optimal Deviation (%)
------------------------
Definition:
    Deviation of path cost from the known optimal/shortest path.
Computation:
    ((path_cost - optimal_cost) / optimal_cost) × 100
Interpretation:
    Lower deviation indicates near-optimal performance.
Unit:
    Percentage (%).

10. Minimum Clearance (m)
-------------------------
Definition:
    Smallest distance from any path point to the nearest obstacle.
Computation:
    Distance Transform EDT at sampled points.
Interpretation:
    Higher clearance means safer paths, less risk of collision.
Unit:
    Meters (m).

11. Average Minimum Clearance (m)
---------------------------------
Definition:
    Mean clearance across all sampled path points.
Interpretation:
    Represents general safety margin maintained along the path.
Unit:
    Meters (m).

12. Clearance Variability
--------------------------
Definition:
    Variance in clearance values sampled along the path.
Computation:
    Variance of per-point minimum distances to obstacles.
Interpretation:
    Low variability = consistent safety margin; high variability = risky fluctuations.
Unit:
    Meters² (variance).

13. Danger Zone Violations
--------------------------
Definition:
    Number of times the path enters a predefined danger radius around obstacles.
Computation:
    Count of sampled points along the path where clearance < danger radius.
Interpretation:
    Higher values mean the path frequently risks collisions.
Unit:
    Count (integer).
