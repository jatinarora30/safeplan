\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Signed Distance Field (SDF) guided A$\ast$ planner for N-\/dimensional occupancy grids. 

Implements an A$\ast$ variant that uses a Signed Distance Field (SDF) to bias search toward safer regions. The environment is an N-\/D Num\+Py occupancy grid where value 0 denotes free space and value 1 denotes an obstacle. The planner accepts start and goal grid indices and returns a collision-\/free path if one exists.

Key ideas\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A standard grid A$\ast$ framework\+: priority queue, cumulative path cost, and a neighborhood that includes all immediate offsets.
\item An SDF-\/based safety term\+: a distance transform and its gradient encourage exploration toward areas with better clearance (see safety\+Heuristics()).
\item A combined priority\+: mixes travel distance, path cost so far, and a local safety measure based on the SDF gradient along the current motion direction (see combined\+Heuristics()).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Heuristic and neighborhood generation are provided by heuristics() and adjacent\+Coordinates(). Ensure the heuristic is compatible with the allowed moves and step costs.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Constructor Arguments}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily k1} \+: float — weight on path-\/cost term inside the combined priority
\item {\ttfamily k2} \+: float — weight on heuristic distance term inside the combined priority
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Inputs (to @ref plan())}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily start} \+: tuple\mbox{[}int, ...\mbox{]} — start grid cell (for example, (row, col))
\item {\ttfamily goal} \+: tuple\mbox{[}int, ...\mbox{]} — goal grid cell
\item {\ttfamily grid} \+: numpy.\+ndarray (N-\/D), values \{0=free, 1=obstacle\}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Outputs}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily success} \+: int — 1 if a path is found, else 0
\item {\ttfamily path} \+: list\mbox{[}tuple\mbox{[}int, ...\mbox{]}\mbox{]} — sequence of cells from start to goal (inclusive)
\item {\ttfamily info} \+: list\mbox{[}str\mbox{]} — diagnostics (for example, \char`\"{}\+Invalid goal\char`\"{})
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Coordinates are handled in grid index space.
\item The SDF is computed once per plan call using a distance transform on the free space mask; its gradient is reused in the safety term.
\item The neighborhood includes all immediate offsets except the zero vector.
\item The safety term normalizes the SDF gradient change along the current motion direction, with simple clamping to avoid division by zero.
