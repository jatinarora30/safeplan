 {\bfseries{Safe\+Plan}} is a benchmarking suite for evaluating classical and modern path planners in robotics with a strong emphasis on {\bfseries{safety, smoothness, and optimality}}. ~\newline
 Unlike existing frameworks (e.\+g., Path\+Bench), which primarily measure path cost and runtime, Safe\+Plan introduces {\bfseries{safety-\/critical and dynamics-\/aware metrics}} that better reflect the requirements of real robotic systems.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Planner-\/agnostic}}\+: Works with any planner that outputs a path on a grid or occupancy map. ~\newline

\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Safety-\/aware metrics}}\+: Beyond length and time, includes clearance, risk exposure, danger zone violations. ~\newline

\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Smoothness evaluation}}\+: Turning angles, jerk (third derivative of position), zig-\/zag count. ~\newline

\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Optimality \& efficiency}}\+: Path cost deviation from shortest path, success rate, computation time. ~\newline

\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Extensible framework}}\+: Add new metrics or planners with minimal boilerplate. ~\newline

\item 🔹 {\bfseries{Batch evaluation}}\+: Run thousands of randomized start-\/goal trials across multiple maps and export results to CSV/plots.

Safe\+Plan provides a {\bfseries{rich set of metrics}} \+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Safe\+Plan Benchmarking Metrics (\+Summary)}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Path Cost (m)\+:}} ~\newline
 Total geometric length of the path in meters, based on Euclidean distance between waypoints. Lower cost indicates a shorter and more efficient route. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Planning Time (ms)\+:}} ~\newline
 The time taken by the planner to generate a path, measured in milliseconds. Faster planners achieve lower values. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Success Rate (\%)\+:}} ~\newline
 Percentage of planning attempts that successfully reach the goal. Higher success rate reflects reliability of the algorithm. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Distance to Goal (m, failures)\+:}} ~\newline
 Distance from the last explored path node to the goal when planning fails. Smaller values show the planner got closer to success. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Nodes in Path\+:}} ~\newline
 Number of waypoints in the final path. Fewer nodes suggest a smoother, simpler, and more direct path. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Peak Memory (KB)\+:}} ~\newline
 Maximum RAM used by the planner during execution. Lower values indicate more memory-\/efficient planning. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Turning Angle (°)\+:}} ~\newline
 Sum of all angular deviations along the path. High turning angles mean sharper, less smooth turns. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Jerk per Meter\+:}} ~\newline
 Rate of change of acceleration normalized by distance. Captures path smoothness—lower jerk means more stable and comfortable trajectories. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Optimal Deviation (\%)\+:}} ~\newline
 Deviation of the computed path length from the known optimal path. Lower percentages mean closer-\/to-\/optimal planning. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Minimum Clearance (m)\+:}} ~\newline
 The smallest distance between the path and any obstacle. Higher values reflect safer paths. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Average Clearance (m)\+:}} ~\newline
 Mean clearance maintained along the path. Represents the overall safety margin to obstacles. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Clearance Variability\+:}} ~\newline
 Variance of clearance distances along the path. Low variability indicates consistent safety, while high variability indicates fluctuating risk. ~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Danger Zone Violations\+:}} ~\newline
 Number of times the path enters within a predefined danger radius around obstacles. Higher counts suggest higher collision risk. ~\newline
